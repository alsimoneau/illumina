The content of this directory refer to typical files
than can be used to model most situations. There are
basically 3 types of files:

1-Lamp fixture angular emission functions most of them
obtained by horizontal averaging of real IESNA files 
(.lop extensions.

2-Lamp spectal power distributions obtained
experimentally by using a stellarnet spectrometer. Most
of them extracted from the Light spectral power
distribution database (LSPDD.org - .spct extensions).


3-Spectral sensitivity curves that represents the
response of a given phenomenon to different wavelength.
You will find some satellite or instrument
sensitivities (like VIIRS-DNB - .dat extensions) as 
well of filter transmittance (like Johnson-Cousin
filters), spectral sensitivities of biological
phenomenon (like the scotopic or photopic vision - .dat
extensions) and ground reflectance files (like asphalt
and snow reflectances - .asper extensions).


Wavelength units are nanometers
